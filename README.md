A modular Discord bot using Golang plugins

## Built With
- [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)
- [Go Plugins](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/)
- Some time and effort

## Usage
In order to build this software, you must be running Linux/MacOS, as Go plugins are not supported on Windows.
With that said, you may `make all` in order to build both all plugins, and the main executable.
If that's too complicated, just `make run` and it'll do all the hard work for ya. Just make sure to
copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and fill it in with the correct values.
